# hash crack 2

Typically to when multiple users have the same password it has the same hash, to prevent this a salt is usually concatenated to the end before hashing to change the hash.

Crack the SHA1 hash given the dictionary. And the given salt `flowers`. 

The hash is `4f8f5f7b8374b43c480aaa3de737d81039b01196`. 
Write your own script to brute force it using a script with `sha1sum` or equivalent.


That is the password for the next level.
