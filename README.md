# TO BE NAMED

Based on OverTheWire's wargames - designed to be between bandit and leviathan  

## General Description

Each level is relatively independent to the next, though sometimes one level depends on the knowledge of another  
You first ssh into {first level} (as both the username and password), complete that challenge then the resulting flag is the password for the next level  
All passwords are stored in `/hacknotts/secrets/<username>_password` and are only accessible by their user  

## Setup

Take a plain ubuntu install (nothing important), run general_setup scripts  
Everything else - On you
