# hash crack 2

Typically to when multiple users have the same password it has the same hash, to prevent this a salt is usually concatenated to the end before hashing to change the hash.

Crack the SHA1 hash given the dictionary. And the given salt `post`. 

The hash is `ca9af7ff4b59eb6239e45a6db81b7b78cf258935`. 
Write your own script to brute force it using a script with `sha1sum`.


That is the password for this level.
